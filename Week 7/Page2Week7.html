    <h1 class="heading"> My Story</h1>
    <p class="font">There once was a minor magic minion named Krog. Krog wasn't <br>
      very popular, his skin was weird and had no beard. He always wanted <br>
      to join the other minor magic minions in fun games. But due to being teased <br>
      he lost hope in joining. That was until he started wearing his new hood! It was <br>
      special and new, made by his mom for his birthday! Made from the softest materials<br>
      around. It was as warm as a winter coat, as soft as a blanket, and as cooler than anything<br>
      else around! As Krog wore the hood, he found himself being talked to more! With people wanting to<br>
      sit with him at lunch! Finally he felt like he could join everyone!
