Mind Set:  

When it comes to the idea of mindset I would say that it hasn’t really changed. At least due to this activity in particular.
My result was 40, indicating that while I have more of a growth mindset. However, this doesn’t mean I totally subscribe to that mindset and I can personally vouch for this. 
Before college I was much more fixed in my mindset, thinking much more of people’s skill was a natural talent. 
But after seeing my own growth as an artist and in my ability to take criticism. Has changed my mindset quite a lot.
However, there is still some concept of innate talent that sets people apart that I find myself thinking about.
This is somewhat restrictive however I believe that as I get older and more experienced.
