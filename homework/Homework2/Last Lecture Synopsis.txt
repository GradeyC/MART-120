The Last Lecture is an hour-long presentation done by Randy Pausch. It details some of his personal life events and how those show that anyone has an amazing capability. 
Starting from when he was a child dreaming of becoming an astronaut and detailing how events in his life opened doors for him. 
This idea of capabilities and personal growth through goals did resonate with me. 
As I have goals for the future, like wanting to get into more drawings and possible content creation. However find that I have a tendency to not believe in myself fully,
 but when I do and push myself past my comfort zone. I end up making what I personally consider to be decent work. 
The idea that you can accomplish your dreams is something that I believe we talk about a lot but don’t always show. 
At times citing examples that could have been from long ago.
 This leads to the realization that the past achievements did have other circumstances and can at least in my opinion dishearten people.
 This is somewhat related to the concept that not getting what you want may not be seen as a good thing. While I understand the frustration that this can bring. 
I believe the experiences that are gained from failure or not getting your way are more important. 
As it can help point towards finding your dreams and understanding your path than always succeeding.
 Personally I have seen myself grow during my education and it has given me more faith in myself.
 Not every work I’ve made for an art class or every paper I’ve wrote are perfect. But this message is something that in my own opinion is not brought up enough.
 Personally seeing how it can work does inspire me to move past it.
